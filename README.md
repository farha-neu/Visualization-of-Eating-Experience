## Visualization of Eating Experience for Self-reflection on Eating Behaviour
It's a semester final group project of Information Visualization course to promote self-reflection on eating behaviour. When we look at the applications in the market, we have seen tons of apps focus on tracking food nutritional information, such as carbs, calories, sugar, etc. The goal of current tools is to promote awareness of healthy eating and potentially change eating behavior. However, eating experience can be influenced by a variety of dimensions, including elements that are external to an individual (e.g., time, location, companion, weather, distraction) and elements that are internal to an individual (e.g., mood, how hungry you are). In this project, we are focused on visualizing eating experiences to promote self-reflection on eating behavior.
